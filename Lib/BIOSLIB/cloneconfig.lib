/***** Cloning Information *******************************************
 When after cloning starts, the LED on the cloning board goes out.
 It begins toggling about every second after the initial loaders
 are transfered and running.
 When cloning is finished, the LED stays on. If any error occurs
 while cloning the LED will start blinking. Possible errors are
 autobaud failed, flash write failed, checksum incorrect.
