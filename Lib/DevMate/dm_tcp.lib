/* START LIBRARY DESCRIPTION *********************************************
DM_TCP.LIB

DESCRIPTION:
   This library contains target-side routines for communication with a
   DeviceMate processor.  This API allows TCP/IP functionality, including
   UDP and DNS lookups, to be accessed from the target processor.

PORTING NOTE:
   For non-Rabbit target processors with an ANSI C compiler, there are
   equivalent .c and .h files in the LIB\Target subdirectory.

CONFIGURATION MACROS:
	The following macros may be defined before inclusion of this library.

	DEVMATE_TCP_TCBUFSIZE
	   Defaults to 133, which allows for 128-byte data packets plus the
	   5-byte XTC header.

	DEVMATE_TCP_XTCBUFSIZE
	   Defaults to 256.  Must be greater than or egual to
	   DEVMATE_TCP_TCBUFSIZE-5.

	DEVMATE_TCP_MAXSOCK
		Defaults to 4.
	   Maximum number of sockets (implemented as XTC "channels") that are
	   allowed.  Generally, this limits the number of sockets on the
	   target since the target is assumed to be more resource-constrained
	   than the DeviceMate.  The actual maximum is determined by the
	   minumum value configured on the target or DeviceMate processor.
	   Note that this value does not include the so-called "control"
	   channel (channel 0).  Available socket numbers run from 1 to
	   DEVMATE_TCP_MAXCHANS inclusive.  The function devmate_tcp_maxsocket()
	   returns the actual negotiated maximum socket number.

	DEVMATE_TCP_NUMRXBUF
	   Defaults to 3.  Specifies the number of target communications
	   receive buffers.  A higher number allows greater performance, at
	   the expense of additional memory usage.

	DEVMATE_TCP_NUMTXBUF
	   Defaults to 1.  Specifies the number of target communications
	   transmit buffers.  Do not set higher than 2.  2 is only necessary
	   if the highest possible speed is required.

	DEVMATE_TCP_MAXRESOLVE
	   Defaults to 1.  Specifies the maximum number of concurrent DNS
	   (Domain Name Server) lookups.  Set to 0 if DNS not required.

	DEVMATE_TCP_DEBUG
		Defaults to not defined.  If defined, then Dynamic C debugging is
		turned on for all functions herein.

GLOBAL VARIABLES:

   TCTcpipState _tct;
      One instance of this structure contains all necessary state
      information for TCP/IP communication.  This library is thereby
      made non-reentrant, however application code may serialize access
      to these API functions so that the library may be used in a multi-
      tasking environment.

API FUNCTIONS:
   See individual function description for details.  None of the
   functions in this library are "blocking" i.e. they all set some
   internal state, but return immediately (possibly without actually
   accomplishing their intended goal).  Thus, it is usually necessary
   to call the same function multiple times in order to complete the
   action.  Such functions are noted as such in their individual
   descriptions.

   Most of the functions require a "socket" parameter.  Unlike the
   native DCRTCP.LIB TCP stack, where sockets are actually pointers
   to structures, sockets in this library are simply small numbers
   which are basically selected by the application.  Only a limited
   number of sockets may be in use at the one time.  This number is
   configured in TC_TCP.LIB, via the DEVMATE_TCP_MAXSOCK define.  This
   number defaults to 4, but may be overridden by the application.
   The total number of sockets is the minimum of the number
   configured for the target and DeviceMate processors.  This
   minimum number is available by calling the devmate_tcp_maxsocket()
   function, after devmate_sock_init().  The returned number may
   be less than DEVMATE_TCP_MAXSOCK if the DeviceMate does not
   support as many sockets as the target.

   Note that the socket number space is shared between TCP and UDP
   sockets.  For application with resource constraints, sockets
   should be closed when not in use.  Allocation of socket numbers
   is entirely the application's responsibility, however the
   socket open APIs can assist in locating an unused socket number,
   if a zero socket number is passed as the first parameter.

   Initialize connection to DeviceMate:
   	int devmate_sock_init()
   	int devmate_tcp_status()
   Open TCP or UDP sockets:
   	int devmate_tcp_open()
   	int devmate_tcp_listen()
   	int devmate_udp_open()
   Check socket status:
   	int devmate_tcp_isestablished()
   	int devmate_tcp_error()
   	uint16 devmate_tcp_readable()
   	uint16 devmate_tcp_writable()
	   int devmate_tcp_isclosed()
   Read or write TCP (stream) data:
   	int devmate_tcp_fastread()
   	int devmate_tcp_preread()
   	int devmate_tcp_fastwrite()
   Close socket:
   	int devmate_tcp_close()
   	int devmate_tcp_abort()
   	int devmate_udp_close()
   Read or write UDP (packet) data:
   	int devmate_udp_sendto()
   	int devmate_udp_send()
   	int devmate_udp_recvfrom()
   	int devmate_udp_recvdata()
   Miscellaneous:
   	int devmate_ip_resolve()

                 to re-establish the link.  An error typically occurs
                 because there is either no DeviceMate, or because the
                 DeviceMate is not configured for TCP/IP support.

DESCRIPTION:   Open a TCP socket via the DeviceMate.  This is implemented
               as a macro which invokes devmate_tcp_start().

PARAMETER1:    Socket number to use.  This may be a number between 1 and
               devmate_tcp_maxsocket() inclusive; the application must
               select a socket number which is not already open or in use.
               This may also be 0, in which case an unused socket number
               will be selected (and returned as a positive number).
PARAMETER2:    A local port number to use.  If zero, then a port number
               will be assigned automatically.
PARAMETER3:    The name of a remote host to connect to.  This may be
               a dotted quad (e.g. "10.10.6.2") or a host name (e.g.
               "ftp.zworld.com" or "server_host").  If a host name is
               given, then the DeviceMate will look up the host's IP
               address using DNS.
PARAMETER4:    The port on the remote host to connect to.

RETURN VALUE:  0: the open request could not be performed; try again
                  later.  This may be because the DeviceMate is not yet
                  fully linked, or because there is temporary buffer
                  shortage.
               positive: opened successfully.  The return value is the
                 same socket number as passed in the first parameter, or
                 the assigned socket number if the requested socket was 0.
               -1: error; remote host not available.
               -2: error; DeviceMate not linked because devmate_sock_init
                 has not been called.
               -3: error; requested socket number out of range.
               -4: error; requested socket already in use.
               -5: error; requested socket number zero, but none free.

DESCRIPTION:   Open a TCP socket via the DeviceMate.  This is implemented
               as a macro which invokes devmate_tcp_start().  The socket
               is opened passively, meaning that it waits for active
               connections from other host(s).  The application must
               periodically call devmate_tcp_isestablished() to check
               whether any connection has been made.

PARAMETER1:    Socket number to use.  This may be a number between 1 and
               devmate_tcp_maxsocket() inclusive; the application must
               select a socket number which is not already open or in use.
               This may also be 0, in which case an unused socket number
               will be selected (and returned as a positive number).
PARAMETER2:    A local port number to use.  This must be specified.
PARAMETER3:    This is normally NULL, to allow any remote host to
               establish a connection.  If not null, it specifies the
               only host allowed to establish a connection with this
               socket.
PARAMETER4:    This is normally 0, which allows connections from any port
               on the remote host.  If non-zero, then the remote host
               must connect from this port number.

RETURN VALUE:  0: the open request could not be performed; try again
                  later.  This may be because the DeviceMate is not yet
                  fully linked, or because there is temporary buffer

KEYWORDS:      DeviceMate tcpip

DESCRIPTION:   Open a UDP socket via the DeviceMate.  This is implemented
               as a macro which invokes devmate_tcp_start().  UDP
               datagrams are delivered reliably (via an XTC channel) to
               the DeviceMate, which then sends the datagram using
               normal UDP which, by its nature, is an unreliable delivery
               service.

PARAMETER1:    Socket number to use.  This may be a number between 1 and
               devmate_tcp_maxsocket() inclusive; the application must
               select a socket number which is not already open or in use.
               This may also be 0, in which case an unused socket number
               will be selected (and returned as a positive number).
PARAMETER2:    A local port number to use.  If zero, then a port number
               will be assigned automatically.
PARAMETER3:    The name of a remote host to connect to.  This may be
               a dotted quad (e.g. "10.10.6.2") or a host name (e.g.
               "ftp.zworld.com" or "server_host").  If a host name is
               given, then the DeviceMate will look up the host's IP
               address using DNS.  For UDP, this parameter may also be
               NULL.  In this case, no host is selected as a default;
               devmate_udp_sendto() must be used to specify a remote
               host on a call-by-call basis.  If a non-NULL host is
               specified, then that host is used as a default destination
               if devmate_udp_send() is used; however devmate_udp_sendto()
               may still be used to direct datagrams to other hosts.
PARAMETER4:    The port on the remote host to connect to.  This may be

                 the assigned socket number if the requested socket was 0.
               -1: error; remote host not available.

DESCRIPTION:   Check the socket to see if a TCP (stream) connection is

               opening a socket with devmate_tcp_listen(), this function

               This function may also be used for actively opened TCP
               sockets to check that the connection is still open.

PARAMETER1:    The socket number as used by devmate_tcp_open/listen().

RETURN VALUE:  0: no connection is currently established.
               1: a connection is currently established, or was
                 established but immediately closed with no transfer of
                 data.  It is possible to read zero or more bytes of
                 data.
               -1: a connection was established but immediately aborted.
                 devmate_tcp_error() will return a non-zero code for
                 further diagnostic information.

DESCRIPTION:   Return the number of data bytes which may be written to
               the socket transmit buffer.  The return value is encoded
               such that it can be interpreted as a boolean indicator

PARAMETER1:    The socket number as used by devmate_tcp_open/listen().

RETURN VALUE:  0: the socket is not writable e.g. it is not open, or
                 encountered an error.
               non-zero: the number of bytes which can be written, plus 1.
                 E.g. if the return value is 200, then 199 bytes can be
                 written immediately using devmate_tcp_fastwrite().  If the
                 return value is 1, then the socket is writable but there
                 is currently no space for new data in the transmit buffer.
                 The latter situation occurs when new data is being
                 generated faster than it can be transmitted to the
                 DeviceMate or remote host.

DESCRIPTION:   Write up to length bytes of data from buffer into the

               this function.  Once the data is buffered, then the

               to the DeviceMate, so long as the application keeps
               calling the devmate_tick() function.

KEYWORDS:      DeviceMate tcpip

DESCRIPTION:   Close a socket forcibly.  This is used to signal the peer
               that the stream is in error.  The peer may or may not
               actually receive the abort indicator; however the
               library considers the socket to be closed.  After
               calling this function, devmate_tcp_error() will return
               a non-zero code.

               Note that sockets are sometimes forcibly closed by other
               library functions.  For example, if devmate_sock_init()
               is called, then any open sockets will be aborted.

               This function is also used to close UDP sockets.  In this
               case, there is no special meaning to "abort", since UDP
               sockets are not connection-oriented so either peer may
               close its socket at any time.

DESCRIPTION:   Transmit a UDP datagram to the specified remote host and
               port number.  UDP datagrams are sent in two phases: the
               data is reliably transmitted to the DeviceMate, then the
               DeviceMate sends the entire datagram on the network.  The
               initial phase may require sending the datagram in more
               than one chunk, if the local transmit buffer is not large
               enough to contain the entire datagram (and header).  This
               requires that the application call this function repeatedly
               until the return value indicates that all data has been
               buffered.  When re-calling, do not change any of the
               passed parameter values except for trans.

PARAMETER1:    The socket number as used by devmate_tcp_open/listen().
PARAMETER2:    Pointer to the start of the datagram to transmit
PARAMETER3:    Total length of the datagram
PARAMETER4:    Zero on first call to transmit a new datagram.
               Subsequently, is the number of bytes that have been
               transferred so far i.e. the return value from the
               previous call to this function.
PARAMETER5:    IP address of the remote host.  This may be zero to use
               the host selected on the initial call to open the UDP
               socket.  Otherwise, this must be a binary IP address
               either hard-coded or obtained from devmate_ip_resolve().
PARAMETER6:    Remote UDP port number.  May be zero to use the port
               selected on the initial call to open the UDP socket.

RETURN VALUE:  -1: an error occurred.
               non-negative: the total number of bytes whcih have been
               successfully transferred from this datagram.  If this is
               less than 'length', then this return value should be
               provided to a subsequent call to this function to complete
               the transfer of this datagram.  If equal to 'length', then
               the datagram has been fully transferred so that a new
               datagram may be transmitted.

KEYWORDS:      DeviceMate tcpip

DESCRIPTION:   Receive notification of UDP datagram availability from the
               given socket.  If a datagram is available, the data may be
               retrieved using one or more calls to
               devmate_udp_recvdata().  This two-phase receive process is
               a consequence of the reliable transport between the target
               and DeviceMate processors, and the possibly limited buffer
               space on the target.

               This function only notifies of the presence of a new
               datagram.  Usually the data would be retrieved using
               devmate_udp_recvdata(), however if this function is called
               again before reading the data (or partially reading it),
               then the rest of the previous datagram will be discarded.
               It is thus not necessary to call devmate_udp_recvdata()
               if the actual data is not important.

PARAMETER1:    The socket number as used by devmate_tcp_open/listen().
PARAMETER2:    Pointer to a place to store the IP address of the sender.
               This may be NULL if the sender's address is not required.
PARAMETER3:    Pointer to place to store the sender's port number.  May
               be NULL if not required, however if NULL it is not
               possible to distinguish between reception of a zero-length
               datagram and no datagram at all.

RETURN VALUE:  -1: an error occurred.
               0: no datagram is available (try again later), or a
                 zero-length datagram is available.  These two cases are
                 distinguished by examining the returned remote port:
                 this will be zero if there is no datagram, or non-zero
                 if there is a zero-length datagram.
               non-negative: the received datagram length, including zero.

               not change any of the passed parameters except for recv.

PARAMETER1:    The socket number as used by devmate_tcp_open/listen().
PARAMETER2:    Pointer to start of datagram buffer.
PARAMETER3:    Maximum length of the datagram buffer.
PARAMETER4:    Number of bytes transferred by previous calls to this
               function.  This should be zero for the first call, then
               should be the returned value from the previous call.
               This allows the datagram to be transferred piecemeal.

RETURN VALUE:  -1: an error occurred.
               non-negative: the total number of bytes transferred so
                 far.  If this is less than the length originally returned
                 by devmate_udp_recvfrom(), then this function may be
                 called again (with this return value passed as the recv
                 parameter) to get the remainder of the datagram.

DESCRIPTION:   Perform a DNS (Domain Name Server) lookup of an internet

               may be resolved simultaneously if the appropriate state
               information is retained.

PARAMETER1:    Pointer to a "handle" which is used to identify the
               resolver request.  This handle should be initialized to
               zero for the first call for a given host name.  On
               return, the handle will be set to a unique identifier.
               On subsequent calls, the same handle must be passed until
               success or failure is declared.
PARAMETER2:    The host name to resolve.  This may be an internet host
               name, or a "dotted quad" e.g. "10.10.6.2".  The same
               host name should be passed on all calls to this function
               (for a particular request id) until the name is resolved.
PARAMETER3:    Pointer to place to store the resolved IP address.

RETURN VALUE:  -2: programming error - DeviceMate not initialized or no
                 name resolver has been configured.
               other negative value: an error occurred.
               0: try again later.
