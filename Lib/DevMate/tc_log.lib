/* START LIBRARY DESCRIPTION *********************************************
TC_LOG.LIB
	Copyright (c) 2001, ZWorld.

DESCRIPTION:
   This library contains structure and object definitions which are
   common to the DeviceMate and target processors.  TC_LOG.LIB is
   automatically included by DM_LOG.LIB and TARGETPROC_LOG.LIB.
   In turn, this library includes TC_XTC.LIB since logging uses
   XTC as the transport.

PORTING NOTE:
   For non-Rabbit target processors with an ANSI C compiler, there is
   an equivalent .h file in the LIB\Target subdirectory.

   The structures defined herein are designed to align and pack
   the same way on most architectures.  Specifically, 16-bit values
   always start on even offsets, and 32-bit values start on multiple-
   of-4 offsets.  All structures' total length is a multiple of the
   size of their largest field, avoiding padding.  This is important,
   since the structures are sent on the wire.  The main incompatibility
   is one of byte ordering.  On the wire, little-endian ordering is
   used.  This is no issue for Intel-derived processors, however most
   other processors (e.g. Motorola, Sparc, ARM, IBM mainframe (!))
   use big-endian byte ordering.  Such processors will need to perform
   byte-swapping on the structures defined here before transmitting
   them.
