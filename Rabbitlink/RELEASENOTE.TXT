******************************************************

  after applying this update.

FIRMWARE VERSION 2.05

  Dynamic C 7.30
******************************************************
FIRMWARE VERSION 2.00

Features
- DHCP is enabled by default now. This can be turned
  off with the console command "set dhcp off", to
  revert back to normal static addresses.

Updates & Bugfixes
- The loader is consistent with the DevMate, and
  therefor should be much more stable.
- The console option "set poll" has been removed,
  as it no longer applies.
- The console option "set progbaud" has been
  removed, as that baud rate is controlled by
  Dynamic C directly now.
- Due to fundamental changes, the polling-lockup
  bug is no longer applicable.
- Due to fundamental changes, the problem of stdin
  characters not being received is no longer applicable.
- The console has been updated to match changes in the
  underlying ARP code.

******************************************************
FIRMWARE VERSION 1.05

Features
- Updated for compatibility with Dynamic C 7.05
  changes.  Older RabbitLinks will still work with
  newer versions of Dynamic C, and vice-versa.

******************************************************
FIRMWARE VERSION 1.04

Features
- RabbitLink now has the option of keeping background
  polling enabled at all times.  This ensures that 
  communication via the program download cable will
  not be lost, even after a power cycle.  A console
  command has also been added to enable/disable
  this feature.
  
Bug Fixes
- Defect #289 fixed. RabbitLink no longer loses 
  serial console communication with the target in 
  normal run mode.

******************************************************
FIRMWARE VERSION 1.03

Features
  - Remotely download/debug any Rabbit-based board
    running Dynamic C 7.03 or later over an
    Ethernet network or the Internet.
  - Provide a web page and email access for any
    board via a serial port (or through the program
    download cable for a Rabbit-based board).
