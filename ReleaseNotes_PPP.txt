VERSION 2.02

NEW FEATURES

BUG FIXES
--Defect 80926 fixed. PPP stack will wait for IPCP ACK before
  establishing connection. This defect is actually fixed in 1.01.
--Defect 80925 fixed. Buffers with bad packets will always
  be reallocated. This defect is actually fixed in 1.01.
--Defect 81407 fixed.
  Buffers with crc errors will not cause the rx buffer byte
  counter to be incorrectly decremented.  PPP was refusing to
  connect, reseting or stopping for a couple seconds.

****************************************************************

NEW FEATURES

--This version works with the Dynamic C 9.0 release of the
  tcp/ip libraries.
--Initial PPP link negotiation is now more flexible, which
  will allow a connection to be established with a wider
  variety of peers.  In particular, peers which do not want/need
  their own IP address are handled correctly -- in this case,
  a dummy IP address (0.0.1.<iface>) is used internally so that
  the router tables work.
--There is a new ifconfig() command word, IFS_PPP_PASSIVE.
  This is a boolean option.  If set TRUE, then the PPP interface
  will wait indefinitely for a peer to start negotiating the
  link parameters.  While waiting, the interface will be in
  a pending up condition.  When the PPP interface is first
  brought up, the library tries to negotiate with a peer.  If
  there is no peer, then the negotiation times out and the
  library drops back to passively waiting.  In this condition,
  it is necessary for the peer to transmit the first link
  negotiation packet, which would normally bring the interface
  up.
--You can #define PPP_NO_MODEM to eliminate modem handling code
  from the PPPLINK (PPP over async serial) library.  This would
  be used if the connection is a direct RS232 connection via
  a null modem, or a leased line.  In this case, the ifconfig
  command IFS_PPP_USEMODEM will have no effect.
--If using a modem, the send/expect strings set via the
  IFS_PPP_SENDEXPECT and IFS_PPP_HANGUP ifconfig() commands may
  contain the following substitution variables:
    %0 - occurrences of this string get replaced with the string
         set via IFS_PPP_REMOTEAUTH, i.e. the user name which
         is presented to the peer.
    %1 - is the corresponding password set via IFS_PPP_REMOTEAUTH.
  These substitution are useful in the case that the peer (ISP)
  requires a human-readable login screen to be navigated, and
  this uses the same userid/password that is used by the PAP
  (Password Authentication Protocol) layer in PPP.

BUG FIXES

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES
--The implementation has been reworked in order to support
  the xmem buffering introduced in the main tcp/ip libs.
  This saves about 6kB of root data space, however there
  is a slight (<1kB) increase in the amount of root code space
  that is used by the PPP library.  If an existing PPP
  application that works with Dynamic C 8.5 or earlier is
  recompiled for this version, then it may be necessary to
  increase the definition of DATAORG by one page (4kB).
--If IFS_PPP_REMOTEAUTH, IFS_PPP_LOCALAUTH, IFS_PPP_SENDEXPECT,
  IFS_PPP_HANGUP or any other parameter which takes a string
  parameter are used, the specified string(s) must be located in
  static storage.  This is because only the pointers are stored;
  the string is NOT copied.  You may need to review your
  application if porting from a previous release of PPP in order
  to check that these ifconfig() commands are used properly.
  You should also check that your application does not change
  the string contents while an interface is coming up or down.
  Is is, however, perfectly OK to change the string when the
  interface is fully up or down.  Such a change will take effect
  the next time the interface is brought up or down.
