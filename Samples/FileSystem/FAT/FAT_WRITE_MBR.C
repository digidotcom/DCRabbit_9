        Samples\FileSystem\FAT\fat_write_mbr.c

        Requires that you run this on a core module with a FAT compatible
        flash memory device.  This sample works with the primary device
        defined by MBR_DRIVER_INIT as the default.  If you need to work
        with a different device, uncomment the appropriate MBR_DRIVER_INIT
        definition to override the core module's default primary setting.

        This sample creates multiple partitions on an UNFORMATTED flash
        device.  It only writes the partition table to the MBR, it does
        not format the individual partitions.  This can be done through
        the sample programs fmt_device.c or fat_shell.c.  Note that the
        FAT_MAXPARTITIONS macro definition in FATCONFIG.LIB may first need
        to be updated to suit a large number of partitions that are to be
        formatted and used simultaneously.

        If the device is not present, unresponsive or already formatted,
        this sample will exit with an error message.

        You can erase a serial flash device by running sflash_inspect.c
        and clearing the pages 0 through 5, inclusive.

        You can erase a NAND flash device by using nflash_inspect.c
        and clearing the pages 0 & 1.  Be aware that multiple
        partitions on an xD card are not supported by most PCs, so if
        you need your xD card to be PC compatible, use one partition.

        FAT does not support multiple partitions on miniSD flash cards,
        this sample will error if run on a miniSD card.
