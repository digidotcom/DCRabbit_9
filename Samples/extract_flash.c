	extract_flash.c
	
	A program you can compile to RAM on Rabbit hardware in order to dump a copy
	of the firmware stored on the flash.  You can use the Rabbit Field Utility
	(RFU) to install the firmware on a new board after converting the Base64
	dump to a binary file (using the built-in Windows command-line CERTUTIL.EXE).
	
	You may need to temporarily comment out compiler warnings in BOARDTYPES.LIB
	around line 336:
		#error "Compile to RAM option programs the battery-backed RAM on CS1 and destroys any persistent data stored there."
		#fatal "Comment out this error if you still want to run off the ram on CS1."

	Limitations
	===========
	Limited testing included devices with 256KB and 512KB flash configurations,
	but not 128KB (BL1810 and BL1820).  Detecting prog_param structure (used
	to calculate image size) worked on firmware built with Dynamic C versions
	from 8.61 to 9.62.
	
	Appears to work with 512KB flash, but not dual-256K flash boards (RCM2260).
	
	Not designed/tested for systems using the DLM/DLP or "COMPILE_SECONDARY_PROG"
	compiler option.
	
	If you need to comment out the compiler warnings in BOARDTYPES.LIB (see
	above), this process will erase the board's non-volatile, battery-backed RAM.
	
	If extracting the entire flash, look for a large run of 0xFF bytes to find
	the end of the program.
	
	How to use it
	=============
	Run from Dynamic C and confirm that the program finds the prog_param
	structure at the start of the flash.  It uses that structure to
	determine the firmware image size.  Without it, it will just dump the
	entire flash and you'll have to manually truncate it.
	
	Then run from the command line and confirm that it still works.  If you leave
	the IDE running, be sure to choose "Close Connection" from the "Run" menu
	to free up the serial port.
	
		C:\DCRABBIT_9.62>dccl_cmp Samples\extract_flash.c
		
	Then run again with DUMP_FIRMWARE defined to create a base64-encoded file.
	NOTE: This will take minutes to complete -- be patient!  You can monitor
	progress by checking the file size in another window.
	
		C:\DCRABBIT_9.62>dccl_cmp Samples\extract_flash.c -d DUMP_FIRMWARE > firmware.b64

	Then use the Windows program CERTUTIL.EXE to convert it to a binary file:
	
		C:\DCRABBIT_9.62>certutil -decode firmware.b64 firmware.bin

	You should now be able to program a new board with firmware.bin using RFU.
	
	If you want an image of the entire flash, define the macro DUMP_FLASH
	instead of DUMP_FIRMWARE.

	Configuration Options
	=====================
	By default, this program just tries to determine the size of the firmware
	stored in the flash by looking for a structure called "prog_param" stored
	in the BIOS of the firmware.
	
	Define the macro DUMP_FIRMWARE to actually dump the firmware image (if it
	can determine the size) as Base64-encoded data.
	
	Or, define the macro DUMP_FLASH to skip image size detection and dump the
	entire flash (including UserBlock(s) and SystemIdBlock).
